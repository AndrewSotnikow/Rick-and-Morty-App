# Rick and Morty App

My project is an app that shows you all the important details about your favorite heroes from the popular TV show "Rick and Morty". The app was built using React, TypeScript, and Styled-components. It's really easy to use and lets you filter and select heroes based on their species. All the information shown on the app is obtained through an API.
